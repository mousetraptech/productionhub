BOOTH BRAIN
Operations Manual
Draylen Mason Music Studio

V1.0 — February 2026
Dave Lindquist

This document defines the complete MOD operational workflow at DMMS.
It serves as both a human-readable reference and the foundational
knowledge base for the Booth Brain intelligent assistant.

Purpose
This manual defines the complete Manager on Duty (MOD) workflow at the Draylen Mason Music Studio. It serves two functions:

1. Human reference: A step-by-step operational guide that any trained MOD can follow to run a professional event, regardless of technical background.
2. Machine knowledge base: The foundational dataset for Booth Brain, the intelligent booth assistant that will translate natural language into system commands via Production Hub.

The design principle is simple: every piece of operational knowledge that lives in Dave’s head needs to live in this document. If Dave gets hit by a bus, this manual and Production Hub should be enough for a competent person to run a show.
System Architecture
The DMMS booth runs five primary systems, all orchestrated through Production Hub:

System
Protocol
Controlled Via
What It Does
Allen & Heath Avantis
MIDI over TCP
Production Hub
Audio mixing — channel faders, DCAs, scene recall, mutes
ChamSys QuickQ 20
OSC relay (UDP)
Production Hub
Lighting — playback stacks, fader levels, cue execution
PTZ Cameras (VISCA)
VISCA over TCP
Production Hub
Camera positions — preset recall, pan/tilt/zoom
OBS Studio
WebSocket v5
Production Hub
Video switching — scene selection, recording, streaming
TouchDesigner
OSC relay (UDP)
Production Hub
Projection/visuals — graphics overlays, media playback

🧠
BOOTH BRAIN
Booth Brain sits above Production Hub as a reasoning layer. It translates natural language intent into structured commands. Production Hub validates and executes. The LLM never touches gear directly.

The critical design principle: Production Hub speaks five different protocols so the MOD doesn’t have to. The MOD sees human-readable actions (“House to Half”) and hits GO. Everything underneath is invisible.
Phase 1: Open
Estimated time: 15–20 minutes before client arrival. The MOD arrives, opens the facility, and powers up the booth.

⚠️
WARNING
NEVER shut down the Mac computers. They stay on 24/7. If a well-meaning MOD powers them off, remote access is lost and the next person has to troubleshoot why systems aren’t responding. The only things that get powered on/off are monitors and boards.
Phase 2: Prep
The MOD checks A/V requirements and sets up equipment for the specific event. Complex audio setups are handled by an A1 (Jeffrey or another audio engineer). The MOD handles everything else.

Check PlanningPod for A/V requirements
PlanningPod (web)
Requirements unclear or missing
Can interpret A/V requirements and generate setup checklist
12
Determine if A1 is needed for audio setup
Human judgment
MOD attempts setup beyond their skill level
Knows the boundary: handhelds/lavs = MOD; band/multi-mic/monitors = A1
13
Set up wireless mics from charging station
Wireless mics
Dead batteries; wrong frequencies; mics not on correct channels
Knows mic inventory, channel assignments, battery check procedure
14
Set up projection if needed (laptop → switcher → projector)
Video routing
Wrong input on switcher; projector not detected; resolution mismatch
Knows signal path and standard routing
15
Position cameras to starting presets
PTZ cameras / VISCA
Camera offline; preset not programmed
Knows camera IPs, default presets per event type
16
Verify OBS is on correct scene profile
OBS (WebSocket)
Wrong profile loaded; OBS crashed overnight
Knows OBS profiles per event type; can verify and switch
17
Verify QLab show file is loaded
QLab
Wrong show file; file corrupted
Knows show file naming convention and expected cue structure
18
Confirm recording is ready (always on)
OBS / Kiloview
Recording drive full; wrong destination folder
Recording is ALWAYS assumed. Knows drive capacity check and default paths

🧠
BOOTH BRAIN
Recording is not a decision — it’s a default. Every event gets recorded. The only conditional is whether we’re ALSO streaming. Booth Brain should treat “start recording” as part of every pre-show sequence automatically.
Phase 3: Client Arrival
This is the hospitality layer — the part that is fundamentally human and cannot be automated. The MOD is the client’s point of contact. Read their energy, manage expectations, make them feel like the room is theirs.

19
Greet client, walk the room together
Human
Client unhappy with layout; unexpected requests
Cannot automate. This is hospitality.
20
Confirm setup matches client expectations
Human
Last-minute changes to plan
Can help MOD assess feasibility of changes
21
Handle curveballs (“we need to livestream”)
Multiple
MOD doesn’t know how to add streaming mid-prep
This is where Booth Brain earns its keep. MOD types “add livestream” and BB knows: confirm stream key, switch OBS profile, start stream output.
22
Sound check (A1 if complex; MOD if simple)
Avantis / mics
Mic not working; feedback; wrong channel
Knows basic troubleshooting: check battery, check mute, check channel assignment

🧠
BOOTH BRAIN
Curveball handling is the highest-value Booth Brain scenario. The client asks for something that wasn’t in PlanningPod. The MOD shouldn’t have to know how to spin it up from scratch. They type what they need in plain English, and Booth Brain translates it into system commands.
Phase 4: Show
The MOD executes cues on the showcaller’s command. For most events, the showcaller is Stacey or Dave. The MOD is the hands; the showcaller is the voice.

What Can Go Wrong
Booth Brain Knows
23
Hold for doors — wait for showcaller
Human
MOD opens doors without clearance
Knows show state: “pre-show hold” until showcaller calls doors
24
Doors open — fire walk-in cues (lights, music)
Production Hub (QLab → ChamSys, Avantis)
Wrong cue fired; cue doesn’t execute
Knows cue stack position; validates before firing
25
Fire cues on showcaller’s command throughout show
Production Hub (all systems)
Missed cue; fired wrong cue; system unresponsive
Tracks current position in cue stack; confirms next cue before firing
26
Camera operation (if assigned, or if Jack shows up)
PTZ cameras / VISCA
Camera on wrong preset; two people fighting for control on same machine
Knows camera control should be on a SEPARATE surface from cue engine. Separation of concerns.

⚠️
WARNING
Do NOT delete, modify, or “clean up” network patches, QLab cues, or system configuration during a live show or in front of clients. If something looks redundant, leave it alone. Document it for later review. Broken signal paths during a show are unrecoverable in real time.

The three things a MOD typically does during a show:
1. Switch camera angles in OBS
2. Fire projection/media cues in QLab
3. Trigger lighting looks on ChamSys

Everything else (live audio mixing, stage monitor adjustments, complex camera work) is A1/L1 territory unless the MOD has been specifically trained and cleared for it.
Phase 5: Strike & Closeout
Post-show teardown and facility closure. The MOD handles recording archive, basic teardown, and power-down. Significant cable strike is A1 territory. L1 handles lighting teardown if it was a busked show.

WARNING
NEVER shut down the Mac computers during closeout. Monitors off. Boards off. Macs stay on. Always.
Decision Boundaries
A core function of this manual is defining what the MOD handles independently vs. what requires escalation. Booth Brain must understand these boundaries to avoid guiding a MOD into territory beyond their training.

MOD Handles Independently
• House and studio lighting (nLight presets, ChamSys playback via Production Hub cue stack)
• Simple wireless mic setup (1–2 handhelds or lavs from charging station)
• Camera preset recall (PTZ to pre-programmed positions)
• OBS scene switching and recording start/stop
• QLab cue firing on showcaller’s command
• Projection routing (laptop to switcher to projector)
• Room setup and teardown
• File archive (Kiloview stop, copy to flash and Flex drives)
• Facility open/close

Escalate to A1 (Audio Engineer)
• Multi-microphone setups (3+ mics, stage boxes, complex patching)
• Band/ensemble audio (monitor mixes, IEMs, drum mics)
• Live audio mixing during shows
• Significant cable runs or cable strike
• Any audio troubleshooting beyond “check battery, check mute, check channel”

Escalate to L1 (Lighting Engineer)
• Programming new lighting cues or busking a show live
• Lighting fixture troubleshooting
• DMX addressing or patching
• Lighting-specific cable strike

Escalate to Dave
• Production Hub configuration changes
• Network infrastructure (switch config, VLAN, IP assignments)
• QLab show file creation or modification
• System integration issues (device not responding, protocol errors)
• Anything that involves editing config files, terminal commands, or code

🧠
BOOTH BRAIN
Booth Brain must never guide a MOD into escalation territory without flagging it. If a MOD types “add a drum mic to channel 15”, Booth Brain should respond: “That’s an A1 task. Is Jeffrey or another audio engineer on site today?” Not attempt the routing itself.
Where AI Helps vs. Where a Checklist Is Fine
Not every step needs intelligence. This section maps each phase to the right tool.

Checklist Is Fine
Steps 1–6 (facility open) are pure procedure. A laminated card on the wall handles this. Booth Brain adds no value here except maybe reminding a new MOD what’s next if they ask.

Steps 7–10 (power up and recall scene) are procedure with one decision point: which Avantis scene. Booth Brain can help here by reading PlanningPod and suggesting the correct scene, but a printed scene-to-event-type matrix on the wall works too.

Steps 27–37 (strike and closeout) are reverse procedure. Same as open — a checklist handles it.

AI Adds Real Value
Steps 11–18 (prep) are where Booth Brain starts earning its keep. Interpreting A/V requirements from PlanningPod, generating a setup checklist, knowing which OBS profile and QLab show file map to this event type — that’s contextual reasoning, not rote procedure.

Steps 19–22 (client arrival) are the highest-value AI scenario. Curveball handling. “The client just asked for livestreaming and it wasn’t in the plan.” A checklist can’t help with that. An intelligent system that knows the booth architecture can.

Steps 23–26 (show) are mostly cue execution, which Production Hub already handles beautifully. But real-time troubleshooting (“camera 2 isn’t responding”) is where Booth Brain can walk a MOD through diagnostics without calling Dave.
What’s Next
This document is V1 — the skeleton. It captures the operational workflow and decision boundaries that Booth Brain needs to understand. The next steps:

1. Fill in troubleshooting trees. For each “What Can Go Wrong” cell, document the diagnostic steps. This becomes the troubleshooting knowledge base.
2. Document the signal flow. A complete map of every audio, video, lighting, and network path in the booth. Physical connections, IP addresses, port assignments.
3. Define the action vocabulary. Every human-readable action that Production Hub supports, mapped to the OSC commands underneath. This is the contract between Booth Brain and the execution layer.
4. Build the prototype. Feed this document into a Claude API call as context. Point it at Production Hub’s action registry. Let a MOD type natural language and see what comes back. Cloud-dependent, not for live shows — but proves the concept.
5. Go local. Once the schema is validated through real show scenarios, fine-tune a small local model (8B parameter, RTX 4060/4070 class hardware) that can run in the rack with zero cloud dependency. That’s the production Booth Brain.

The AI isn’t the product. The accessibility is the product. The AI is just how you get there.
